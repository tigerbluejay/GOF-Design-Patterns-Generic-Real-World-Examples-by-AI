# GOF Design Patterns
# Generic and Real-World Examples by ChatGPT AI

This Solution is a working compilation of the GOF Design Patterns.
Projects contain anotated generic examples with additional comments or real world implementations of the patterns.

I asked ChatGPT to rank in order of complexity for human understanding and it provided the following ranked list, which I recommend when reading through and debugging the examples.

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Observer
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Command
- Proxy
- Iterator
- Composite
- State
- Bridge
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Mediator
- Visitor
- Chain of Responsibility
- Flyweight
- Memento
- Interpreter
