/* In this example, we have the IHttpService interface, which serves as the subject. The HttpService 
 * class is the real implementation of the subject and represents the actual HTTP service, utilizing the 
 * HttpClient class.
 * 
 * The HttpServiceProxy class acts as a proxy for the HttpService and provides additional behavior 
 * before and after the real service call. It initializes the HttpService when needed and delegates 
 * the GetData method call to the real service.
 * 
 * In the client code, we create an instance of the HttpServiceProxy and call the GetData method through
 * the proxy. The proxy adds custom behavior before and after calling the real service's GetData method, 
 * such as logging or additional processing.
 * 
 * This example demonstrates how the Proxy pattern can be used in a .NET context to provide additional 
 * functionality or control around an existing class or service, such as adding logging, caching, or 
 * security checks to an HTTP service.
