/*
In this example, we have an interface called IPrototype that defines the Clone method. The ConcretePrototype class implements this interface and 
provides its own implementation of the Clone method by creating a new instance of itself. The ConcretePrototype also has a Display method to 
demonstrate its uniqueness.

The Client class holds a reference to the prototype and can make a copy of it using the MakePrototypeCopy method, which calls the Clone method 
on the prototype. Finally, in the Main method, we create an original ConcretePrototype object, create a client with that prototype, make a copy, 
and display the original and cloned objects.

Please note that this is a simplified example to illustrate the concept of the Prototype design pattern in C#. In practice, you may have more 
complex object structures and variations of cloning logic based on your requirements.

The console output of the provided example will be:

ConcretePrototype: Original Object
ConcretePrototype: Original Object

Both the original object and the cloned object will have the same name, "Original Object," because the Clone method in the ConcretePrototype 
class creates a new instance but does not modify the internal state. Therefore, when we call the Display method on both objects, they will 
display the same name.

The design pattern is called the "Prototype" design pattern because it involves creating new objects by cloning existing objects, 
which serve as prototypes. The prototype object acts as a blueprint or template from which other objects are created.

The main idea behind the Prototype design pattern is to allow object creation without specifying the exact class of the object that needs to 
be created. Instead of creating objects directly using constructors, the pattern provides a mechanism to create new objects by cloning existing ones. 
This approach provides flexibility by allowing the creation of new objects with different initial states while avoiding the complexities of 
subclassing.

By using prototypical cloning, the pattern allows us to create new objects by copying the state of an existing object, thereby avoiding 
the need for creating objects from scratch or using complex initialization logic. This can be particularly useful when object creation is 
expensive or requires a significant amount of data.

In summary, the Prototype design pattern is called so because it revolves around creating new objects based on prototypes, which are existing 
objects that serve as templates for the creation of new objects.

In the following line:         

ConcretePrototype clone = client.MakePrototypeCopy() as ConcretePrototype;

Is as "as ConcretePrototype" part necessary, why and why not?

The "as ConcretePrototype" part in the line ConcretePrototype clone = client.MakePrototypeCopy() as ConcretePrototype; is not necessary, but it 
depends on the specific requirements and design of your application.

The purpose of using the "as" keyword in C# is to perform an explicit type conversion or cast and assign the result to a variable. 
It attempts to convert the expression on its left-hand side to the type specified on its right-hand side. If the conversion is successful, 
it assigns the converted value to the variable; otherwise, it assigns null.

In the context of the Prototype design pattern, the MakePrototypeCopy method returns an IPrototype object. If you are confident that the 
returned object will always be an instance of ConcretePrototype, you can use the "as" keyword to explicitly cast it to ConcretePrototype. 
This will allow you to assign the result directly to a variable of type ConcretePrototype. If the cast fails, the result will be assigned as null.

Here are a couple of scenarios where the "as ConcretePrototype" part may be necessary:

If you have specific methods or properties defined in ConcretePrototype that you need to access, and they are not part of the IPrototype interface. 
By using the "as" keyword, you can gain access to these specific members.

If there's a possibility that the MakePrototypeCopy method may return different implementations of the IPrototype interface, and you want to 
ensure that you are working with a ConcretePrototype object. In this case, using the "as" keyword allows you to check if the cast is 
successful and handle the case where the returned object is not of type ConcretePrototype.

However, if you are only interested in the common functionality provided by the IPrototype interface and don't require any specific
members of ConcretePrototype, you can omit the "as ConcretePrototype" part. In that case, you can directly assign the result to a variable of 
type IPrototype without performing an explicit cast.
